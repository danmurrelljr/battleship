# Battleship
Simple battleship implementation in node.js, v6.11.0 or newer

Run using

  `node battleship.js`

Creates a gameboard of arbitrary size, and places ships randomly throughout.
Just a fun little exercise to practice Javascript and node.

I was going to solve this in a more straightforward way, but midway through thought this could be cleaner as a class.
Then I wondered how functional I could make it while still being easy to read and understand. I could still probably go further.

v0.1 - Create game board and place ships
